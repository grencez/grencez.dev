# About

Hi, I'm Alex Klinkhamer.
You may remember me from such [research papers](https://dblp.org/pid/133/7778) as [Shadow/Puppet Synthesis: A Stepwise Method for the Design of Self-Stabilization](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2016.2536023) or the related [NP-completeness](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03089-0_12) and [undecidability](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-03089-0_12) proofs.

This site contains small projects, proof-of-concepts, and notes about how to do Linux stuff.
I use Gentoo btw.
